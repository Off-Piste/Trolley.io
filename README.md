WIP

This is the new branch for 0.2.0+!

We have decided upon changing the way our code works and remove all help from external projects or if not rebuild them to suit our needs, i.e simplify PromiseKit & Socket Rocket as we have moved toward a ObjectiveC & Swift 50/50 code base so we can supply the code to both parties and take advantage of the Pros for each language

Please bare with as i'm on my own with this and ObjectiveC isn't my primary language, so it is going to be a learning curve, but will come back faster and easier to use for both worlds.

Thanks for your patience - [Harry](https://github.com/harrytwright)
