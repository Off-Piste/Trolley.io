Trolley is e-commerce system that allows users to create fast and easy to use iOS Shops without having to wait time building a server

<GIF OF Application Examples>

# Features

- **Mobile Friendly:** Many competitors forget about handheld devices, we don't. Never again will you have to use someones Shopify wrapper to build your iOS store.
- **Swift Built:** This allows all the fun parts of Swift coding to come into play, less crashes and more fun.
- **ObjectiveC Support:** To help with developers who still love ObjectiveC, they can still use our SDK, some things are missed out but still as fun to use.
- **Promise Kit:** Built around promise kit, so all the async code runs perfectly
